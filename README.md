============================

A twitter bot platform, mainly built for my own narcissistic ideals.

The idea is that you associate a twitter user with rules and schedules, allowing an easy way to do particular things.

There's one file that's gitignored - private/oauth.json:
```json
{
  "service": "twitter",
  "consumerKey": "KEY",
  "secret": "SECRET"
}
```
Please add that yourself to allow authentication/oauth with twitter.
